***LOW COST VR TREAD TECH***

**Project Overview**
This project uses Arduino-powered controls to translate walking motion into USB joystick controls, allowing users to control their computer using a walking motion. The goal is to be easy to build at home using non-specialist parts, keeping costs low and accessibility high.

**Arduino board**
Joystick library (https://github.com/MHeironimus/ArduinoJoystickLibrary)
Arduino Pro Micro - It is recognised as a *human input device* (HID)


**Design Options**
This project includes two design options:

A 1m radius circle that the user stands in to control their computer. This design will be made of 8 series of rollers giving N, S, E, W, NE, SE, SW, and NW directions.

A smaller, under-desk version that is 3/8 of a circle. This will mean a roller series for forward walking, and two smaller either side for strafing movements.


**Materials**
The rollers are made from foam pipe insulation, which is a low-cost and easy-to-find material.
Linear potentiometers to monitor the angle of each roller
Elastic bands to return the roller to a neutral position

**Cost**
The ultimate goal for this project is to offer low-cost options.
The under-desk version is designed to be built for less than Â£100, making it an affordable option for anyone who wants to try out this unique way of controlling their computer.

**Work in Progress**
Please note that this project is still a work in progress and may undergo further changes or updates.
